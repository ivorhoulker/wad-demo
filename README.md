This is a quick demo of Wad.js built with React.

The project video demonstration is located here:  https://youtu.be/KBurf-pTwLA?t=919.  Some of the code has been updated / improved.

This works best in Chrome.  Some functionality does not work as intended in Firefox (individual track volume adjustment on the fly) or Safari (does not support 2D panning).  Wad.js will need to improve cross browser compatibility, or I will have to manually fix it some day (although this is just a demo, so maybe don't count on it).

Install via `npm install` and run via `npm run start-dev`.
