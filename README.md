This is a quick demo of Wad.js using React.

The project video demonstration is located here:  https://youtu.be/KBurf-pTwLA?t=919

This works best in Chrome.  Some functionality does not work in Firefox (individual sound volume adjustment on the fly) or Safari (does not support 2D panning).  It's possible I will fix this some day, but since this is just a demo to illustrate Wad.js and Web Audio API, I wouldn't count on it.

Install via `npm install`
Run via `npm run start-dev`
